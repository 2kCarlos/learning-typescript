# Learning TypeScript

This is my first time going through JavaScript and TypeScript for real.

I want to understand the workflows in creating, testing, and running web development code with TypeScript and NodeJS.

## Resources

I am following a tutorial series from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI). 

Their repository example can be found [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/typescript-tutorial).

### Other

- [Installing TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
- [TypeScrypt for Java/C# Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-oop.html) _(notably important, since I have a strong background in Unity + C#)_
